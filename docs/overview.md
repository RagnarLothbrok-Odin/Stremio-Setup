# Stremio Setup Guide

Welcome—this guide takes you from a clean slate to a fast, reliable, and visually polished Stremio setup. It’s opinionated where it matters (quality, speed, organization) and flexible where it should be (addons, artwork, lists).

:::: tip What is Stremio?
Stremio is a modern media center for movies, shows, and more—powered by community addons. You assemble your experience by installing addons for discovery, metadata, and streaming.
