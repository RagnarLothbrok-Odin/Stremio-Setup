# Final Cinebye Configuration

This is the final step in your Stremio setup. We need to reorder your addons to ensure optimal performance and proper metadata display.

## Reorder Addons

If you kept the Cinebye configuration page open from the [preparations step](/preperations/cinebye), great! If not, simply navigate back to [https://cinebye.dinsden.top/](https://cinebye.dinsden.top/) and log in with your Stremio account.

### Step 1: Access Addon Management

1. Scroll down to the section titled **"ðŸ“¦ Manage Addons"**
2. You'll see all your installed addons listed

### Step 2: Reorder Addons

Drag and reorder the addons to ensure the following order at the top:

1. **AIOMetadata** (should be first)
2. **AIOStreams** (should be second)

### Step 3: Sync Changes

1. Scroll back up to the section titled **"3 Sync Addons"**
2. Click **"Sync to Stremio"** to apply the changes

## Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

- âœ… Enhanced metadata from AIOMetadata
