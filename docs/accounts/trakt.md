# Trakt Account

Trakt tracks what you watch and powers recommendations. We’ll connect it to Stremio later.

## Sign Up

- Open: [Trakt sign up](https://trakt.tv/auth/signup_method)
- Choose Email, Apple, or Google and complete sign‑up

## Where You’ll Connect It

Later, from Stremio’s Integrations page:

- Open: [Stremio Account Login](https://www.stremio.com/login) → **Integrations** → **Trakt Scrobbling** → **Authenticate**

:::: tip Optional but Helpful
Automatic scrobbling keeps your watch history in sync across apps, note that Stremio will still automatically sync across your account with or without Trakt.
