# Debrid Service Account Setup

A debrid service is a premium service that provides access to high-quality, fast streaming links. While some may tell you debrid services are not required, they significantly enhance your streaming experience beyond just privacy.

::: tip Highly Recommended
There's a common misconception that debrid services only hide your downloads from your ISP. In reality, debrid services are designed to provide not only more links but higher quality and faster streaming options. Regardless of your local country's copyright laws, a debrid service is always recommended for the best Stremio experience.

## What Debrid Services Provide

- **Higher Quality Links** - Access to 4K, HDR, and premium quality streams
- **Faster Streaming** - Optimized servers for better performance

- **Reliability** - More stable and consistent streaming experience
- **Better Organization** - Cleaner, more organized link results

## Popular Debrid Services

There are several debrid service options available, with **Real-Debrid** being the most popular and commonly used choice. This popularity is largely due to its excellent value proposition - at approximately $37 USD/year, it provides access to practically any movie or show ever made.

When compared to traditional streaming platforms like Netflix (approximately $96 USD/year for the cheapest plan, which includes advertisements and is limited to 1080p with a restricted catalog), Real-Debrid offers significantly better value for money.

## Important Limitations

### IP Address Restrictions
Some debrid providers (but not all) restrict usage to 1 IP address, with automatic systems in place to prevent abuse. **Real-Debrid and Premiumize** specifically do not allow multi-IP access.

::: info Check Your Provider
If you're unsure about IP restrictions for your chosen debrid service, check their terms of service or contact their support team directly.
::: 

::: info Important Clarification
This doesn't mean you can only use the service on 1 device. You can use it on multiple devices, but you cannot watch content simultaneously from 2 different IP addresses.
:::

### Multi-User Alternative
If you need multi-user access with unlimited simultaneous IP addresses, **[TorBox](https://www.torbox.app/)** is an excellent option. TorBox operates on a "fair use" abuse policy rather than strict IP limitations.

**TorBox Features:**
- **Unlimited simultaneous IP addresses** - No IP restrictions
- **Fair use policy** - More flexible than traditional debrid services
- **Free plan available** - [Though with significant limitations](https://support.torbox.app/en/articles/9836418-account-restrictions)


::: warning TorBox Cache
TorBox's cache may not be as large as Real-Debrid and Premiumize, but we haven't experienced any issues with content availability so far.
