# Account Creation Overview

Before installing addons, set up the accounts that power metadata, tracking, and high‑quality streaming. Create only what you need today—you can add the optional ones later.

## Categories

### Essential
- **Stremio**: Your main account for syncing and integrations → [/accounts/stremio](/accounts/stremio)
- **Debrid provider**: Enables fast, reliable streams (Real‑Debrid or TorBox) → [/accounts/debrid](/accounts/debrid)

### Highly Recommended
- **TMDB**: Movie/TV metadata and title matching → [/accounts/tmdb](/accounts/tmdb)
- **TVDB**: TV‑focused metadata coverage → [/accounts/tvdb](/accounts/tvdb)

### Optional Polish
- **Trakt**: Automatic watch history and recommendations → [/accounts/trakt](/accounts/trakt)
- **RPDB**: Ratings overlay on posters (free key available) → [/accounts/rpdb](/accounts/rpdb)
- **FanArt**: High‑quality artwork (free API) → [/accounts/fanart](/accounts/fanart)

## Time & What You'll Need

- 10–20 minutes total
- Ability to copy/paste API keys later into addons
