# TMDB Account

TMDB provides rich movie/TV metadata used by AIOMetadata and improves title matching in search.

## Create Your Account

- Open: [TMDB signup](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup)
- Complete the sign‑up and verify email

## Get Your API Key

1. Go to your profile → **Settings** → **API**
2. Create a new API key (read access is sufficient for our use)
3. Copy the key-you’ll paste it into AIOMetadata/AIOStreams later

:::: tip Why TMDB?
Better metadata and matching than Stremio’s default provider; pairs well with TVDB for TV coverage.
