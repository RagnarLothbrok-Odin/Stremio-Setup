# TMDB Account Creation

Creating a TMDB (The Movie Database) account allows you to access comprehensive movie and TV show metadata In Stremio, TMDB is used to replace the default metadata provider (which most users don't recommend) and improve search results through title matching (which we will configure later in the guide)

::: tip Optional but Highly Recommended
TMDB is not required for basic Stremio functionality, but it's highly recommended as it provides essential movie and TV show metadata, posters, descriptions, and other information that significantly enhances your streaming experience. We'll explain its importance in detail later in the guide.
