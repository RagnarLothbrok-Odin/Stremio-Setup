# RPDB Account Setup

RPDB (Rating Poster Database) is an optional service that adds ratings to posters within Stremio, enhancing your visual experience with movie ratings displayed directly on posters.

::: tip Optional Enhancement
RPDB is not required for any Stremio functionality, but it adds ratings to posters which enhances the visual experience. You have two options: use the free API (which we'll configure later) or subscribe to their Patreon for premium features.
