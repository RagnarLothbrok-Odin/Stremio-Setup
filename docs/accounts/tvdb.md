# TVDB Account Creation

Creating a TVDB (The TV Database) account allows you to access comprehensive TV show metadata. In Stremio, TVDB is used alongside TMDB to provide better metadata coverage - while TMDB is mainly for movies, TVDB specializes in TV shows and provides enhanced metadata for television content.

::: tip Optional but Highly Recommended
TVDB is not required for basic Stremio functionality, but it's highly recommended as it provides essential TV show metadata, episode information, and other details that significantly enhances your streaming experience for television content. We'll explain its importance in detail later in the guide.
